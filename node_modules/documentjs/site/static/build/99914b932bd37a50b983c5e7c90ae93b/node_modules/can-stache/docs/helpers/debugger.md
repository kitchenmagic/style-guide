@body

## Use

The `debugger` helper breaks at its place in the template.

During a break, in the paused inspector there is a special `get(<path>)` function to help inspect the current scope. For example, `get("book.title")` will attempt to locate `book` in the current scope and return its `title` property.

Use the helper in development and debugging.
In production, the `debugger` never breaks and instead prints a warning.
